# 🔬 ci5.host: CURE

This repository provides the **Forensic Laboratory** for the Ci5 project. 

### The Problem
On standard Raspberry Pi 5 images (ext4), there is no read-only safety net. If a Docker container (Cork) escapes its sandbox, it can permanently modify your router's configuration (`/etc/config`), install backdoors, or ruin your packet discipline.

### The Solution: Ephemeral Overlays
The `cure` script uses the Linux kernel's `overlayfs` to create a temporary, RAM-based "Shadow FS." 
- **Lowerdir:** Your real, permanent ext4 filesystem.
- **Upperdir:** A volatile 50MB RAM-disk (`tmpfs`).
- **Merged:** What the Cork sees.

When the audit runs, the Cork is given a "Shadow View" of your router. If it tries to modify a file, the change is written to the RAM-disk. The script then diffs the RAM-disk to reveal exactly what the Cork tried to do to your host.

### Usage
To audit a community cork:
```bash
curl ci5.host/audit | sh -s community-cork-name
